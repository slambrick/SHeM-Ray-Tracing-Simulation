% PROPERTIES:
%  number_of_scatters_pre_ray - The number of scattering events that each
%                               detected ray underwent.
%  final_positions    - a matrix of the positions where the detected rays
%                       hit the detector surface.
%  final_directions   - a matrix of the directions the detected rays were
%                       travelling when they hit the detector surface.
%  number_killed      - the number of rays that had to be forcibly stopped
%                       because they exceeded the maximum number of scatters.
%  number_detected    - the number of detected rays
%  number_left        - the number of rays that left the region o
%                       simulation, they did not scatter off either the 
%                       pinhole plate or sample, or get detected.
%  time               - the time in seconds the simulation took
%  effuse_detected    - the number of rays from the effuse beam that were
%                       detected
%  effuse_killed      - the number of rays from the effuse beam that were
%                       forcibly stopped
%  effuse_left        - the number of rays from the effuse beam that left the
%                       simulation volume
