%% Parameter file for SHeM ray tracing
% Most of the basic parameters can be specified here, although there is some 
% greater functionality available through directly editing the main script.
% refer to the seperate file for in depth descritions of parameters.
%
% Lines that start with '%' will be ignored, feel free to add your own comments.

%% Set up your virtual microscope
% stl models of the pinhole plate can also be used, either 'cambridge' or
% specify an stl file found .
Design working distance (mm): 2
Incidence angle (deg): 45
Type of scan: line
Number of detectors: 1
Detector full axes (x,y): (1.4, 1)
Detector centres (x,y): (2.1, 0)
Rotation angles (only needed if 'rotations' scan used): (0, 72, 144, 216, 288)
STL pinhole model: angular resolution

%% Set up your source
% There are two models of the source, 'Uniform' source at the skimmer, or a
% 'Gaussian'. In the first case provide the maximum angular value, in the second
% case provide the angular standard deviation. A cosine effuse beam may also be
% modelled coming from the pinhole.
Number of Rays: 2000000
Pinhole radius (mm): 0.001
Source model: Uniform
Angular source size (rad): 1e-4
Source standard deviation (rad): 0.1
Effuse beam: Off
Effuse size (relative to the direct beam): 1

%% Set up your sample
% There are a few inbuilt samples or you can provide your own stl/obj file of a
% sample, options are: 'flat', 'sphere', 'custom', 'photoStereo'
%  - If you are using the 'sphere' option specify the radius of sphere.
%  - If using the 'flat' option specify the size of the flat square sample.
%  - If specifying your own sample specify the name and path to the stl file,
%    please use a file name and path without spaces
% In general it is advised to avoid manual alignment of the sample
What type of sample are you useing: flat
Scattering: uniform
Reflectivity: 0.1
Standard deviation (deg): 90 
Sample description: Test material sample
Working distance to place the sample at: 2
Sphere radius (mm): 0.15
Length of side of flat sample: 1
Custom sample stl file: samples/four_squares.obj
Manual alignment: no

%% Set up your scan
% This assumes you are doing a 2D rectangular scan centering on the
% middle on the sample.
Pixel seperation (mm): 0.01
Scan range x (mm): 0.8
Scan range y (mm): 0.6
Ignore incidence angle in scan pattern: no

% This assumes you are doing a 1D scan
Scan direction: y
Scan min (mm): -1.5
Scan max (mm): 6
Pixel seperation (mm): 0.05

%% Other parameters
Label for the output directory (no spaces please): test_square_sample
Sould the C code be recompiled: false
