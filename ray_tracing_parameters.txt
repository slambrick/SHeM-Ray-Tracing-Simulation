%% Parameter file for SHeM ray tracing
% Most of the basic parameters can be specified here, although there is some 
% greater functionality available through directly editing the main script.

% Lines that start with '%' will be ignored, feel free to add your own comments.

%% Set up your virtual microscope
% Models of the pinhole plate that can be used, for any of the CAD models
% make sure to set the correct design working distance:
% - 'cambridge', WD=2.12
% - 'angular resolution', WD=2
% - 'cambridge new', WD=2.12
% - 'crude annular', WD=3
% - 'normal incidence 3mm', WD=3?
% - 'N circle'
% New models of plate can be added by creating an appropriate CAD file and
% then writing a function in 'functions/pinhole_plate_import/', and adding
% it as an option in 'functions/pinhole_import.m' and 
% 'functions/parsing_functions/parse_pinhole.m' which parses this file. For
%
% Type of scan can be:
%  - 'rectangular', A single image centred on the centre of the sample
%  - 'rectangular_z', multiple images at a series of z positions
%  - 'rotations',  A series of images rotating the sample
%  - 'line', A single line scan (specify which axis)
%  - 'line_rotations', A series of z scans while rotating the sample
Design working distance (mm): 2.121
Incidence angle (deg): 0
Type of scan: line
Number of detectors: 1
Detector full axes (x,y): (1.4, 1)
Detector centres (x,y): (2.35, 0)
Rotation angles (only needed for 'rotations'/'line_rotations'): (0, -, 2.5, -, 360)
%Z to use (only needed if 'rectangular_z' scan used): (-1, -, 0.5, -, 2) <- TODO
STL pinhole model: N circle

%% Set up your source
% There are two models of the source, 'Uniform' source at the skimmer, or a
% 'Gaussian'. In the first case provide the maximum angular value, in the second
% case provide the angular standard deviation. A cosine effuse beam may also be
% modelled coming from the pinhole.

Pinhole radius (mm): 0.001
Source model: Uniform
Angular source size (rad): 0.0005
Source standard deviation (rad): 0.1
Effuse beam: On
Effuse size (relative to the direct beam): 1

%% Set up your sample
% There are a few inbuilt samples or you can provide your own stl/obj file of a
% sample, options are: 'flat', 'sphere', 'custom', 'photoStereo', 'circle'
%  - If you are using the 'sphere' option specify the radius of sphere.
%  - If using the 'flat' option specify the size of the flat square sample.
%  - If specifying your own sample specify the name and path to the stl file,
%    please use a file name and path without spaces
% In general it is advised to avoid manual alignment of the sample

% middle on the sample.
